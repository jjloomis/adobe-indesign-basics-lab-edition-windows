# Creating a Project Folder

Before starting an InDesign project, you'll need to create a project folder. All media files associated with your project will live in this project folder with your InDesign project file (INDD.)

Never rename, move or delete the media files in your project folder. Your INDD file references these files. If your INDD file can't locate a media file, it will appear offline in your project.

1. On your PC, navigate to your [class folder](connecting-to-your-class-folder.md).
2. Right-click in your class folder. In the fly-out menu, select **New Folder**.
3. Give this folder a new name using [JAMS naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html).
